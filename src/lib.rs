//! Async TLS streams
//!
//! This library is an implementation of TLS streams using the most appropriate
//! system library by default for negotiating the connection. That is, on
//! Windows this library uses SChannel, on OSX it uses SecureTransport, and on
//! other platforms it uses OpenSSL. The usage of OpenSSL can optionally be
//! forced with the `force-openssl` feature of this crate.
//!
//! Each TLS stream implements the `Read` and `Write` traits to interact and
//! interoperate with the rest of the futures I/O ecosystem. Client connections
//! initiated from this crate verify hostnames automatically and by default.
